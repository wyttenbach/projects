VIER-3976 Review VIERS accounts with privileged access - MAR

The VIERS team will review accounts that have elevated access to their
environments to ensure that only approved active accounts/members have
elevated access.

The members of the following groups will be checked each month. Any
accounts that cannot be confirmed/verified will be sent to Fred Spence
to determine the next course of action (likely the deletion of the
account).

The groups to be checked are the following:
aacunixs_vrs_admin_apache_dev
aacunixs_vrs_admin_apache_dr
aacunixs_vrs_admin_dev
aacunixs_vrs_admin_dr
aacunixs_vrs_admin_mqm_dev
aacunixs_vrs_admin_mqm_prep
aacunixs_vrs_admin_mqm_prod
aacunixs_vrs_admin_websphere_dev
aacunixs_vrs_admin_websphere_dr
aacunixs_vrs_admin_wls_dev
aacunixs_vrs_admin_wls_dr
