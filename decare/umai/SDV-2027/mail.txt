Subject: RE: Production COB Error
 
Hi Kathryn,
 
The secondary claim 66433572 initially suspended S11 on Feb 28th (it
did not deny D246). Then when it was repaired then it denied D246. The
reason for the D246 was that the claim was flagged as secondary
however it did not have any primary paid amount. It seems that the
amount was lost during the first repair activity.  Note that the
primary paid amount was in this case at line level and was 0 in all
cases. I am wondering whether we have a bug in the wip screen that
drops line level primary paid amount if it is zero. It could also be
that the user removed it but that is unlikely.

Subject: Production COB Error
 
Hi Michal,
 
I must be missing something obvious. For some reason the secondary
claim is being denied for COB, but the group is setup with COB = None,
and I cannot see any COB amounts or flags on the secondary claim that
would cause this. I was thinking that maybe it was caused by HXC rule
or other rule that was setup with the wrong value, but this doesn’t
seem to be the case. I was trying to think if there was an issue with
the WIP submission process as a result of changes in the Feb release
that might be reporting data it shouldn’t be.  Do you have any ideas ?
 
Primary claim 66261085 – Group # IN69YK-0001, COB Type: Standard
Secondary claim 66433572 – Group # IN674S-0001, COB Type: None (initially denied D246 for COB)

Thanks.
