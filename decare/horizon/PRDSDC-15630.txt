Hi Kathryn,

As it turns out the code thought it was locating the subscriber covered rec=
ord already, but it was calling the wrong method.

It has been this way since the beginning: It would always return the first =
covered in the loop and so if that covered had an end date, the bug would be=
 triggered.
